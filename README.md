# Thermostat
Using a temperature sensor, Arduino microcontroller, LCD shield, buzzer, rotary encoder, buttons, and a servo motor, I created a thermostat to read and regulate the temperature of the room. The user is able to set tempurature bounds, and once the temperature goes above of below said bounds, the program will activate the air conditioning or heater accordingly. Additionally, the servo motor will display the current temperature; however, when the user is setting the bounds, the motor will display the current settings in sync with the rotary encoder input for 4 seconds and return to its inital setting.
